          <p>W3C is convening this virtual workshop to build a shared understanding of how the Machine Learning ecosystem intersects with the Web browsers and help chart its standardization roadmap.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=submit>How to apply to speak?</h2>
          <p>If your experience or expertise in the field has provided you with insights (questions or answers) about this intersection, in particular about the <a href="./#topics">topics in scope of the workshop</a>, please <a href="#submit-form">submit a proposal using the <strong>submit a talk proposal</strong> form</a> <strong>before July 3rd, 2020</strong> and we will work with you in confirming and defining your proposed contribution. You may also <a href="mailto:group-machine-learning-pc@w3.org">contact the Program Committee directly</a> at any time if you have any questions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=why>Why should I apply to speak?</h2>
          <p>Your audience, the workshop participants, will include representatives from the machine learning ecosystem, browser vendors, major library developers, standards organization representatives.</p>
          <p>Browsers are the most widely deployed platform, reaching 4B+ users, with the larger developers community - they provide a key stepping stone to deploy technology at scale.</p>
          <p>Bringing your perspective to this workshop provides a unique opportunity to have a wide-scale and lasting impact on the future usage of machine learning.</p>
          <p>This will also help you establish contacts with new communities and new experts, expanding your network of experts and business relations.</p>
          <p>Beyond the workshop itself, the record of the presentation will be available on the W3C site as part of the event record, and will serve as a point of reference and discussion for the years to come.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=what>What should my talk cover?</h2>
          <p>The Program Committee will review proposed talks to assess they fit well with the call for participation, in particular the list of <a href="./#topics">identified topics</a>.</p>
          <p>Once selected, speakers should aim to provide a talk that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>brings their specific perspective on the topic,</li>
            <li>identifies what barriers may need to be lifted to make browsers a great platform for deploying machine learning applications and services, in particular those where <strong>interoperability and standadization</strong> are likely to play a role,</li>
            <li>shed light on specific aspects or questions the Program Committee will have raised in their review process,</li>
            <li>raise questions of their own that other Workshop participants may usefully provide input on.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Talks are expected to be in the 5 to 10 minutes time range, to ensure as many workshop participants as possible can watch all the submitted talks prior to the live discussions.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=how>How will talks be recorded and presented?</h2>
          <p>Once approved by the Program Committee, talks are expected to be delivered as a combination of a slideset (in HTML or PDF) and a recorded audio or video of the speaker (<strong>without</strong> screen recording of the slides) <strong>before July 31st, 2020</strong>.</p>

          <p>These two elements will then be synchronized and combined to allow Workshop participants to watch presentations at their own pace - see <a href="https://www.w3.org/2020/05/AC/talk/strategy-funnel">an example of this synchronized presentation viewer</a> for a previous W3C event.</p>
          <p>You can find W3C <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Virtual_Presentations">guidance on tools and tips</a> to record yourself. As an alternative, the Program Committee will offer to record speakers over a teleconferencing system (e.g. Zoom) both to help with technical matters and to provide an audience to the speaker, since we recognize that speaking alone in front of a camera is not necessarily an easy exercise.</p>

          <p>W3C provides also <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Speaker_Resources">more general guidance on how to present effectively</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/training/accessible.php#during">in a way accessible to people with disabilities</a>.</p>
          <p>Talks are expected to be delivered in English; as an experiment, the Program Committee will also accept talks delivered in Chinese and Japanese, and W3C will work with the speakers on ensuring their proper transcription and translation in English.</p>

          <p>W3C will provide transcripts and captions for all the selected presentations and will ask speakers' help in reviewing these for accuracy.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 id=other>What other commitments are expected from me if I give a talk?</h2>
          <p>A few weeks after all the pre-recorded talks have been published on the W3C site, the Program Committee will set up a series of teleconferences in September 2020 where each of the workshop topics will get discussed, as informed by the submitted presentations.</p>
          <p>Speakers are expected to the best of their availability to be on the call(s) where the topic of their presentation is being discussed, to answer and raise questions with other workshop participants.</p>
          <p>The Program Committee will also set up asynchronous communication mechanisms (forum, slack) where speakers are cordially invited to participate to exchange with other speakers and workshop participants.</p>
