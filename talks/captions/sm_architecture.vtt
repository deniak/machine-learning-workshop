slide-1
00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:09.666
<v ->Hi, I'm Sangwhan Moon</v>

2
00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:11.066
from the Technical Architecture Group

3
00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.566
also known as the TAG.

4
00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:14.116
And today I will be talking about

5
00:00:14.116 --> 00:00:16.366
how machine learning today will ideally become a part

6
00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:17.976
of the web platform.

7
00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:20.186
To briefly introduce myself as noted earlier

8
00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.946
I am an elected member of the TAG,

9
00:00:21.946 --> 00:00:24.996
team leader then E-commerce Oriented Computers Startup,

10
00:00:24.996 --> 00:00:27.486
and finally a PhD student in Natural Language Processing

11
00:00:27.486 --> 00:00:29.046
at the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

12
00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:30.876
I would like to note that the presentation today

13
00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:31.709
carries more weight

14
00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:32.776
from a personal perspective

15
00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.866
on the topic rather than the formal group message

16
00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:36.476
from the TAG.

slide-2
00:00:36.476 --> 00:00:38.106
Machine learning, namely the sub-field,

18
00:00:38.106 --> 00:00:40.096
which involves using large neural networks

19
00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:41.506
to approximate various functions

20
00:00:41.506 --> 00:00:42.656
through large amounts of training

21
00:00:42.656 --> 00:00:44.076
that have been a hot topic

22
00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:45.736
in the last couple of years.

23
00:00:45.736 --> 00:00:47.786
Due to the social technical impact this has brought

24
00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:48.846
to our lives developers

25
00:00:48.846 --> 00:00:50.966
and users alike expecting this functionality

26
00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.116
to become part of the web platform is a natural progression.

27
00:00:54.116 --> 00:00:56.736
Many operating systems have started providing the APIs

28
00:00:56.736 --> 00:00:59.106
that allow you access to these capabilities,

29
00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:00.456
sometimes which wire directly

30
00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:03.442
to a neural network optimized core processor.

slide-3
00:01:03.442 --> 00:01:04.629
First and foremost we would like to work

32
00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.176
to have a stronger focus on maximizing impact

33
00:01:07.176 --> 00:01:09.286
with smaller incremental changes.

34
00:01:09.286 --> 00:01:11.496
All these topic may still be open for debate,

35
00:01:11.496 --> 00:01:13.046
how we see this is to focus more

36
00:01:13.046 --> 00:01:14.436
on inference rather than try

37
00:01:14.436 --> 00:01:16.856
to tackle training and providing a full blown set

38
00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:18.249
of APIs from the get-go.

39
00:01:19.126 --> 00:01:20.066
The reason for this is

40
00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:21.786
that we see a larger pool of users

41
00:01:21.786 --> 00:01:23.946
on the inference side rather than the training side.

42
00:01:23.946 --> 00:01:26.146
Mainly because having a browser tab open for weeks

43
00:01:26.146 --> 00:01:29.056
doing a training run seems like a less likely scenario.

44
00:01:29.056 --> 00:01:31.416
Eventually we'd like to see more capabilities added

45
00:01:31.416 --> 00:01:33.676
but incremental enhancements allow us as a platform

46
00:01:33.676 --> 00:01:34.936
to adapt to actual user needs

47
00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:35.806
in the world that focus

48
00:01:35.806 --> 00:01:37.469
on fixing easier problems first.

slide-4
00:01:38.406 --> 00:01:40.606
One of the complications in defining a mechanism

50
00:01:40.606 --> 00:01:42.506
to run pre-trained neural network models

51
00:01:42.506 --> 00:01:43.776
in the browser is to agree

52
00:01:43.776 --> 00:01:45.466
on the standard format for packaging

53
00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:47.846
and shipping these neural network models.

54
00:01:47.846 --> 00:01:49.086
Machine learning academia

55
00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:51.336
and the ecosystem of frameworks have still not agreed

56
00:01:51.336 --> 00:01:52.286
on a common format

57
00:01:52.286 --> 00:01:53.296
which makes this challenging

58
00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:54.436
for us as a platform,

59
00:01:54.436 --> 00:01:55.416
as we must choose from one

60
00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:57.876
of the multiple competing proposals.

61
00:01:57.876 --> 00:01:59.716
But we do not have a particular preference

62
00:01:59.716 --> 00:02:01.106
on the specific format,

63
00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:02.186
we'd like to see some form

64
00:02:02.186 --> 00:02:03.716
of convergence to make life easier

65
00:02:03.716 --> 00:02:05.446
for the users of the platform.

66
00:02:05.446 --> 00:02:07.776
The same applies for the shader language for computation,

67
00:02:07.776 --> 00:02:09.936
which as we understand has also has yet

68
00:02:09.936 --> 00:02:11.289
to achieve consensus on.

slide-5
00:02:12.266 --> 00:02:14.136
Additionally while it is possible

70
00:02:14.136 --> 00:02:16.446
to do a lot of this without a permission as of today,

71
00:02:16.446 --> 00:02:18.476
through capabilities already available

72
00:02:18.476 --> 00:02:21.446
in the platform such as WebGL and WebAssembly,

73
00:02:21.446 --> 00:02:23.886
at the point of standardization as a platform API,

74
00:02:23.886 --> 00:02:24.896
we would like to see this

75
00:02:24.896 --> 00:02:27.186
behind the permission if possible.

76
00:02:27.186 --> 00:02:28.716
The reasons for this is not only due

77
00:02:28.716 --> 00:02:30.446
to the potential privacy implications,

78
00:02:30.446 --> 00:02:32.106
but also due to the power requirements

79
00:02:32.106 --> 00:02:34.636
that these APIs may bring to the table.

80
00:02:34.636 --> 00:02:35.966
This can have negative effects

81
00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:37.426
on the battery life for users who get

82
00:02:37.426 --> 00:02:38.566
out of a single charge.

83
00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:40.586
So we believe that the users should have a choice

84
00:02:40.586 --> 00:02:42.226
to reject if they are in a situation

85
00:02:42.226 --> 00:02:43.059
where they would want

86
00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.899
to be conservative about power usage.

slide-6
00:02:46.306 --> 00:02:47.416
An extra point that we'd like

88
00:02:47.416 --> 00:02:48.906
to bring to the attention of the group is

89
00:02:48.906 --> 00:02:50.176
to open questions that remain

90
00:02:50.176 --> 00:02:53.076
to integrate these capabilities to the platform.

91
00:02:53.076 --> 00:02:54.336
Due to the current limitations

92
00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:56.836
of JavaScript such as the lack of operator overloading

93
00:02:56.836 --> 00:02:57.686
it makes it challenging

94
00:02:57.686 --> 00:03:00.246
to implement an ergonomic API for vector matrix

95
00:03:00.246 --> 00:03:03.136
or tensor operations on the web platform.

96
00:03:03.136 --> 00:03:04.456
From a user's perspective,

97
00:03:04.456 --> 00:03:05.716
it's a lot more straightforward

98
00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:07.206
to have infix functions than

99
00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:09.416
to chain the pilot function calls.

100
00:03:09.416 --> 00:03:10.776
The last question we have is

101
00:03:10.776 --> 00:03:12.656
whether there is a path forward to converge

102
00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:16.246
with non-browser JavaScript runtimes such as Node.js.

103
00:03:16.246 --> 00:03:17.336
These are points that are open

104
00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:18.499
for further discussion.

slide-7
00:03:20.136 --> 00:03:22.136
The TAG has two principles that might be useful

106
00:03:22.136 --> 00:03:24.006
for this group to move the work forward.

107
00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:25.226
We have the base guidelines

108
00:03:25.226 --> 00:03:27.026
which is the Design Principles documents,

109
00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:28.526
which touches on how APIs

110
00:03:28.526 --> 00:03:30.236
for the web should be designed,

111
00:03:30.236 --> 00:03:32.086
but also the ethical web principles,

112
00:03:32.086 --> 00:03:33.986
which we recently released.

113
00:03:33.986 --> 00:03:36.426
As capabilities such as computer vision,

114
00:03:36.426 --> 00:03:37.786
which can be achieved with the work

115
00:03:37.786 --> 00:03:39.176
that is being proposed by this group,

116
00:03:39.176 --> 00:03:42.466
can also have wider social and ethical implications,

117
00:03:42.466 --> 00:03:43.516
we'd like the group to look

118
00:03:43.516 --> 00:03:45.376
into the larger scale social impact

119
00:03:45.376 --> 00:03:47.316
by bringing these capabilities to the web,

120
00:03:47.316 --> 00:03:48.886
to mitigate any potential risks

121
00:03:48.886 --> 00:03:51.086
that it may bring to the end user's privacy.

slide-8
00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:55.056
As this is a powerful and complex capability

123
00:03:55.056 --> 00:03:56.426
that we have not previously done

124
00:03:56.426 --> 00:03:57.516
on the web platform,

125
00:03:57.516 --> 00:03:58.906
the TAG would be very interested

126
00:03:58.906 --> 00:04:01.236
in doing early reviews on the topic.

127
00:04:01.236 --> 00:04:03.296
We would be happy to review early proposals

128
00:04:03.296 --> 00:04:04.886
from the contributors of the group,

129
00:04:04.886 --> 00:04:05.936
through our design reviews

130
00:04:05.936 --> 00:04:10.726
repository at github.com/w3ctag/design-reviews

131
00:04:10.726 --> 00:04:12.896
We'd also be more than happy to actively engage

132
00:04:12.896 --> 00:04:15.316
in any cross working group facilitation needed

133
00:04:15.316 --> 00:04:16.566
to make this work happen.

slide-9
00:04:17.876 --> 00:04:19.816
Thank you for listening to my presentation.

135
00:04:19.816 --> 00:04:21.456
I'll be available in the live session

136
00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:23.006
for any questions you may have.
