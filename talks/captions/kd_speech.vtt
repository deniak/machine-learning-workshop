<v Kelly>Hello.</v>

2
00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:12.296
I am Kelly Davis,

3
00:00:12.296 --> 00:00:15.966
the manager of the Mozilla Machine Learning Group.

4
00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:17.126
The title of my talk

5
00:00:17.126 --> 00:00:21.366
is Wreck a Nice Beach in the Browser:

6
00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:24.606
Getting the Browser to Recognize Speech.

7
00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:27.446
So with an eye on the clock,

8
00:00:27.446 --> 00:00:28.699
let's get started.

slide-2
00:00:30.406 --> 00:00:32.789
Here's the general outline of my talk.

10
00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.266
I'll begin with a quick introduction

11
00:00:36.266 --> 00:00:38.116
to speech recognition in the browser.

12
00:00:39.016 --> 00:00:41.166
And follow that with a few words

13
00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:44.296
on the standardization, or lack thereof,

14
00:00:44.296 --> 00:00:47.359
of our browser-based speech recognition API.

15
00:00:48.566 --> 00:00:51.906
Next, I'll move on to examine some

16
00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:54.466
of the hurdles, privacy issues

17
00:00:54.466 --> 00:00:56.386
that arise when one attempts

18
00:00:56.386 --> 00:00:59.259
to bring speech recognition to the browser.

19
00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:03.825
After that, I have a few words to say

20
00:01:03.825 --> 00:01:05.946
on the implementation details

21
00:01:05.946 --> 00:01:09.456
of speech to text in the browser,

22
00:01:09.456 --> 00:01:13.996
to embed or not to embed the speech recognition engine

23
00:01:13.996 --> 00:01:15.179
into the browser.

24
00:01:16.226 --> 00:01:19.156
Finally, I'll conclude with some words

25
00:01:19.156 --> 00:01:21.196
on the current lay of the land

26
00:01:21.196 --> 00:01:23.869
for browser-based speech recognition.

slide-3
00:01:26.436 --> 00:01:30.266
So let us begin at the beginning

28
00:01:30.266 --> 00:01:34.049
with an introduction to speech recognition in the browser.

slide-4
00:01:36.346 --> 00:01:38.596
As I'm sure you're well aware,

30
00:01:38.596 --> 00:01:41.709
there are numerous browser-based APIs

31
00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.576
from Web Audio to Web Workers,

32
00:01:45.576 --> 00:01:48.128
however, the Web Speech API,

33
00:01:48.128 --> 00:01:52.086
the API which is responsible for exposing speech recognition

34
00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:55.239
in the browser, is a bit behind the curve.

35
00:01:56.576 --> 00:02:00.526
It's still only a draft community group report

36
00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:02.526
but it's already old.

37
00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:05.166
It's been around about 10 years.

38
00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:09.676
So speech in the browser is, despite its age,

39
00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:11.609
still rather immature.

slide-5
00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:16.136
One reason for its immaturity

41
00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:18.829
is the struggle over standardization.

slide-6
00:02:20.506 --> 00:02:24.036
The current Web Speech API reflects the times

43
00:02:24.036 --> 00:02:27.599
in which it was originally written about 10 years ago.

44
00:02:28.536 --> 00:02:30.976
In particular, it doesn't make use

45
00:02:30.976 --> 00:02:34.136
of the subsequent advances in, for example,

46
00:02:34.136 --> 00:02:36.476
the Web Audio API.

47
00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:41.426
In addition, there are some privacy issues the API exposes

48
00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:43.159
that still need to be addressed.

slide-7
00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:48.166
Questions of privacy that were present

50
00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:50.426
in the original API

51
00:02:50.426 --> 00:02:53.316
and new ones that arose since the original

52
00:02:53.316 --> 00:02:57.469
was written nip at the heels of standardization.

slide-8
00:02:59.526 --> 00:03:04.526
For example, speech recognition exposes GDPR issues.

54
00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:10.926
If speech recognition happens server side, as it does

55
00:03:10.926 --> 00:03:13.756
in the vast majority of cases,

56
00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.866
and your speech is retained

57
00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:19.586
to help train future speech recognition engines,

58
00:03:19.586 --> 00:03:22.269
as is now a standard in the industry,

59
00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:27.539
how is the GDPR right of erasure implemented?

60
00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:32.739
The current Web Speech API is silent on this point.

61
00:03:34.816 --> 00:03:38.516
Also, if your speech is retained,

62
00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:40.286
as it is for the majority

63
00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:43.169
of server-based speech recognition engines,

64
00:03:44.146 --> 00:03:47.589
how is the GDPR right of access implemented?

65
00:03:49.086 --> 00:03:52.979
The current Web Speech API is silent on this point too.

66
00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:57.546
At the core of these issues

67
00:03:57.546 --> 00:03:59.119
is the issue of consent.

68
00:04:00.226 --> 00:04:03.776
How does the Web Speech API handle the issues

69
00:04:03.776 --> 00:04:08.396
of consent that arise when speech data is stored

70
00:04:08.396 --> 00:04:09.849
and reused server side?

71
00:04:10.946 --> 00:04:13.826
For the future of the Web Speech API,

72
00:04:13.826 --> 00:04:17.299
it is critical to address these privacy issues.

slide-9
00:04:19.206 --> 00:04:23.216
However, some of these privacy issues

74
00:04:23.216 --> 00:04:25.946
can be addressed by addressing the question

75
00:04:25.946 --> 00:04:28.749
of whether to embed or not to embed.

76
00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:34.596
Whether to embed the speech recognition engine client side

77
00:04:34.596 --> 00:04:37.586
or to keep it server side

78
00:04:37.586 --> 00:04:40.199
as is current common practice.

slide-10
00:04:42.616 --> 00:04:47.596
Answering the question to embed or not to embed involves

80
00:04:47.596 --> 00:04:49.159
a number of trade-offs.

81
00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:54.066
Embedding improves latency:

82
00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:56.609
responses are almost immediate.

83
00:04:57.496 --> 00:04:59.039
Privacy and security:

84
00:05:00.046 --> 00:05:02.299
the data never leaves your machine.

85
00:05:03.566 --> 00:05:08.076
It also cuts recurring and non-recurring costs

86
00:05:08.076 --> 00:05:09.609
for the browser provider.

87
00:05:11.736 --> 00:05:14.089
Not embedding has benefits too.

88
00:05:15.786 --> 00:05:18.576
As one has access to more compute,

89
00:05:18.576 --> 00:05:22.529
one can obtain better-quality speech recognition.

90
00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:27.406
Also, one can retain speech data

91
00:05:27.406 --> 00:05:29.966
to learn more about your users

92
00:05:29.966 --> 00:05:33.996
and to use as a source of training data.

93
00:05:33.996 --> 00:05:36.956
In addition, the data retained

94
00:05:36.956 --> 00:05:39.376
is a competitive advantage

95
00:05:39.376 --> 00:05:41.696
over those that change to embed

96
00:05:42.956 --> 00:05:46.639
as they have to obtain training data some other way,

97
00:05:47.696 --> 00:05:51.979
which is usually time consuming and expensive.

slide-11
00:05:54.036 --> 00:05:57.669
With all of this and more in play,

99
00:05:58.886 --> 00:06:02.296
one can see that the lay of the land

100
00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:06.709
for browser-based speech recognition is complicated.

slide-12
00:06:09.376 --> 00:06:13.736
Currently, no browser implements the API

102
00:06:13.736 --> 00:06:16.779
as specified by the Web Speech API.

103
00:06:18.786 --> 00:06:21.176
The current implementations all come

104
00:06:21.176 --> 00:06:25.746
with asterisks, indicating that they are deficient

105
00:06:25.746 --> 00:06:27.246
in some way.

106
00:06:27.246 --> 00:06:30.893
For example, using of a vendor prefix

107
00:06:30.893 --> 00:06:35.726
or putting limitations on how the pages can be served.

108
00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:40.116
So as you can see, the Web Speech API

109
00:06:40.116 --> 00:06:44.239
is currently very much a work in progress.

slide-13
00:06:46.386 --> 00:06:47.946
Fini.

111
00:06:47.946 --> 00:06:49.246
That's the end of my talk.

112
00:06:50.086 --> 00:06:51.136
Thanks for listening.
