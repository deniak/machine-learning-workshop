<section id="intro">
  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Over the months of August and September 2020, W3C conducted a virtual <a href="https://www.w3.org/2003/08/Workshops/">workshop</a> to pave the way for <strong>enriching the Open Web Platform with better
      foundations for machine learning</strong>.</p>

  <h2>Outcomes &amp; Proceedings</h2>
  <p><a href="presentations.html">34 presentations were recorded and published</a>.</p>
  <p>These presentations triggered <a href="https://github.com/w3c/machine-learning-workshop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Discussion+topic%22+">25 online workstreams</a> which were discussed in <a href="proceeding.html">4 minuted live sessions</a>.</p>
  <p>The <strong><a href="report.html">Workshop Report</a></strong> summarizes the key findings from the workshop.</p>

    What was the purpose of this workshop?
  </h2>
  <p>
    The primary goal of the workshop was to bring together providers of
    machine learning toolkits and framework providers with Web platform
    practitioners to <strong>enrich the Open Web Platform with better
    foundations for machine learning</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The secondary goals of the workshop were as follows:
  </p>
  <ul id="secondary-goals">
    <li>Understand how machine learning fits into the Web technology
    stack,
    </li>
    <li>Understand how browser-based machine learning fits into the
    machine learning ecosystem,
    </li>
    <li>Explore the impact of machine learning technologies on Web
    browsers and Web applications,
    </li>
    <li>Evaluate the opportunities for standardization around machine
    learning APIs and formats.
    </li>
  </ul>

    üåê What is W3C?
  </h2>
  <p>
    W3C is a voluntary standards consortium that convenes companies and
    communities to help structure productive discussions around
    existing and emerging technologies, and offers a Royalty-Free
    patent framework for Web Recommendations. We focus primarily on
    client-side (browser) technologies, and also have a mature history
    of vocabulary (or ‚Äúontology‚Äù) development. W3C develops work based
    on the priorities of our members and our community.
