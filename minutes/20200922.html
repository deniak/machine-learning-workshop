<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Introducing live session #2. What will we
cover today? Last Tuesday, we discussed opportunities and
challenges, today focuses on Web Platform foundations, broken into
two parts: creating and deploying models, and extended foundations
for ML. We'll be looking at what ML practitioners do on a regular
basis, but have been missing with on the Web. Web Platform
Foundations: the missing parts.</p>
<p>A quick recap on practicalities: please raise your hand if you
want to speak; introduce yourself if talking for the first time.
Please help correct the minutes as needed. We're operating under
the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> please make sure to speak slowly to help the
  interpreter</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-23"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> the goal of oru session today is to
understand how machine learning fits in the Web technology stack;
we have identified a number of discussion topics for today - we've
picked "only" 6 topics today to leave enough time based on our
  experience last week.</p>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-24"></div>
<p>The first half of the meeting will touch on ML model formats,
protecting ML models, in browser training, and training across
devices.</p>
<p>The second half will look at extending Web foundations for ML:
in particularly how WASI-NN and WebNN related one with another, and
will finish with heterogeneous parallel computing.</p>
<h2>Considerations for creating and deploying models</h2>

    ML model format #74</a></h3>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-26"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Many talks touched on this topic. The high
level issue is that there is no standard format for packaging &
shipping ML models, and ML model formats evolve rapidly. A proposal
that has emerged is to focus on an API that enables loading models
rather than pick a particular format, which is what the community
has already taken up. Sangwhan Moon (who is unable to join us
today) mentioned in his talk that there is no consensus on a format
at the moment. I'm inviting Jonathan to comment on this, as the
author of ML model API explainer, based on the perspective of the
TensorFlow team. What are the abstractions we should be considering
on a long and short term basis?</p>
<p>Jonathan Bingham: First, in the ML space, there are multiple
model formats that are in wide use today. TF is one of them (the
one I'm most familiar with) - in addition to the TF models, there
are ONNX models, CoreML models, many ML practitioners use PyTorch.
What we've seen with all these formats is that they're evolving
rapidly. TF has over a 1000 compute operations that have been
defined, growing by 20%+ per year. The other formats have been
growing rapidly. PyTorch has hundreds, all formats are growing
around 20%+ per year. This growth and lack of stability makes us
think it's not stable enough for standardization. We in TF think we
have have an approach to deal with this, by defining compute at a
lower level than operations, using e.g. MLIR, or compute primitives
- these lower level compute elements can be composed to form
operations, providing a smaller set that would need to be
standardized.Our Recommendation would be to avoid premature
standardization and hope that the&nbsp;field provides good
solutions to this problem. I know that folks at other companies
(incl Microsoft) have worked on ONNX which is meant as an
interoperable format, which could be a great format for the Web. It
too has been growing rapidly but with attention to backwards
compatibility. It could be ONNX is a good long term solution, or
MLIR as a good long term solution, &nbsp;or support multiple
formats as a long term approach. It feels a bit early to pick
one.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Inviting Chai, lead of DirectML and informed
of ONNX to share his perspective based on his work on the WebNN
which he co-edits with Ningxin</p>
<p><cite>Chai:</cite> the ML space is still evolving; we have ONNX,
TF, PyTorch and all the JS frameworks. Presenting a single API is a
future prospect given these rapid evolutions. The way we look at
these systems is that fortunately, every single framework or ML API
turns out to be implemented using the front-end/back-end
architecture - there is already the architecture that allows the FE
to operate unchanged, while the backend could change. My direct
experience with DirectML is that we built DirectML in the OS (in
Windows) and it's used by multiplied FE frameworks, namely ONNX
runtime, WindowsML, and recently TF. When you implement the BE you
get to see the difference and the commonalities across these FE
that you're serving. What's encouraging is that in the BE, it's not
much different. That's how we're approaching the WebNN API design
as well. We've looked across all these frameworks to find the
commonalities across them to make sure that the spec can support
the needs of all these frameworks. Some APIs / frameworks move
faster than others</p>
<p>, but there is a lot of overlap across them and that works in
our favor. We can keep making progress on what would be a Web
backend API for ML, while we wait and see how developers eventually
converge into some framework or APis in the future. TF.js is widely
adopted, and ONNX is used a lot on desktop settings, so there may
be convergence in the future, but we don't have to wait or to force
that unification too early. That's the current line of thinking in
the ML CG. The second thing about MLIR: it could become that
binding between BE & FE in the most flexible way - as becomes
evident in TFRT (?). It's quite promising - that development would
help glue this in a better way moving forward.</p>
<p><cite>Ningxin:</cite> I'd like to add one aspect that was
mentioned in Jonathan's talk - we've found that there is actually
the model execution time spent on compute-intensive operators -
there aren't so many of them (e.g. Convolution, matmul). E.g. for
computer vision, over 90% of time is spent on these operators. In
the CG, we have started with a very small core set of operators
focused on the most compute-intensive ones, which is enough to
provide good hardware acceleration.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> looking at this from a different perspective -
would this work across platforms (desktop vs mobile) or OSes? How
would a developer deal with&nbsp;this?</p>
<p><cite>Chai:</cite> I believe the way to achieve OS portability
is to have the framework sit on top of the Web API that can be
implemented in the browser across different OS. e.g. if TF.js,
currently sitting on WebGL could sit on top of WebNN (which brings
it on par to native performance). WebNN can then build on top of
the OS APIs which would help achieve OS portability, the OS then
takes care of hardware portability.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> how would that extend to the ML loader
API?</p>
<p><cite>Chai:</cite> I think that will become clearer in the
future once we have a standardized backend.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> what about the role of converters - can
anyone speak on this? TF and ONNX have converter projects - is that
part of an interim solution?</p>
<p>Otherwise, it sounds like the proposed approach is our best bet
for the time being</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> are we connected well enough with ONNX and
MLIR to make sure we have stable alignments of interest? Are other
long term candidates in this space we should establish connections
with?</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> we have good connection with ONNX; Jonathan
has served as a contact point with MLIR, so there is a shared
understanding of what everyone is doing.</p>
<h3><a href=

    Protecting ML models #67</a></h3>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-27"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Protecting ML models; some ML providers need
to ensure their models cannot be extracted from a browser app. E.g.
the model is built and tuned to solve their business specific
issues, and are not willing to share it with the world. The
proposal is to investigate existing access control mechanisms for
videos, learnings from 3D assets.</p>
<p>In the discussion in the GH issue, it became evident
that&nbsp;the problem of content protection has emerged in many
places: for videos in particular, for 3D assets in the game of Web
based games. What we've learned from these efforts is that it's not
an easy problem to solve. I would like to invite Jason Mayes to
share his views from TF - his talk mentioned the requirements
they've heard from ML providers.</p>
<p><cite>Jason:</cite> Model security has been a big issue for us,
which we can't solve without browser support. By default, ML can be
explored or exported in a browser. There are use cases where this
isn't a concern, but there are many use cases e.g. in the corporate
ecosystem where ML models are the&nbsp;results of significant
investments, large IPR assets. The only way to get these ML run in
a way that keeps them protected is to do it server-side - with all
the known issues (latency, privacy). Comparing it to video - videos
are single files to be protected - in ML, we need to protect also
pre- and post-processing operations. An approach might be to flag
JS code as needing to run in a secure environment (e.g. protected
memory) from the server, which would prevent the developer to pick
into it.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> browsers are expected to act as agents of the
user - anything that puts them as odd to that is going to be a
challenge - as W3C has experience in EME. @@@ comparison&nbsp;to
native ‚Ä¶ Assuming we could do as Jason describes, this would become
abused by spammers and other creative people when it comes to use
other people's resources. Security protection. Understand that ML
providers are putting efforts in shaping their models.</p>
<p>Users expect to use their devices, so i'm surprised they don't
want to lose&nbsp;control. Native platforms.</p>
<p><cite>Wendy:</cite> W3C Strategy lead and legal counsel . EME
was controversial, faced formal objections and contested appeal
over the presence of DRM in the platform. One of the issues raised
there which would be a challenge here would be security
considerations. How can we guarantee the security of a system where
pieces of it are blocked from view? With ML, I could anticipate the
questions being even greater on the security and privacy front -
how do we guarantee to the &nbsp;that the piece of code they're
asked to run is safe, not privacy invasive, is not exfiltrating
information, etc. I would expect that to be a challenging
discussion - even if I understand the desire to to protect the
asset.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> it was indeed controversial in the context
video - possibly one of the most controversial technical issues in
W3C's history. What would be a sensible next step in this space?
Are requirements similar? How much would it help if we were just to
"hide" these assets - making them more tedious to extract them? Or
allow some level of obfuscate them? How hard do we need to make it
to prevent access to them? We should understand&nbsp;the use cases,
derive requirements and see what our options are.</p>
<p><cite>Zoltan:</cite> would the model loader API that would take
a URL and metadata on privacy/security considerations - the model
would then not be exposed. Is that a feasible path forward?</p>
<p><cite>Jason:</cite> in terms of obfuscation - that's a big no,
there will be tools to un-obfuscate, so not a real issue, and the
said providers will stick to server-side or native. Another point
is that this may be linked to the ML model format - once we have a
well-defined format, there could be guarantees that the format
can't e.g. phone home, only for mathematical operations - that
might help removing some of the security/privacy concerns.</p>
<p>Ping Yu: I'm from Google in the TFJS project; we've discussed
this with a lot of clients and JS platform vendors - how they could
create such a secure execution. There are 2 needs: IPR protection
and user security. From the vendor point of view, the encryption
layer usually implemented in native with negotiation with the
server side for the keys. When the model is executed, it's executed
in a separate context which isolates the memory from other JS. This
gives some security to the model provider - it depends on how much
the adversary is ready to invest in breaking the encryption. If
everything is done on the client side, there will always be ways to
reverse-engineer. To make sure users aren't exposed to malicious
models, various browsers are applying heuristics to determine what
makes a "safe" browser. Definitely a hard problem.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> could we use a distributed approach where the
latency-sensitive&nbsp;bits would be kept on the client stuff, and
the IPR sensitive stuff would be left on the server-side,
connecting the two with a low latency channel (e.g.
WebTransport)</p>
<p><cite>Ping:</cite> there have been explorations in this space
indeed</p>

    In-browser training #82</a></h3>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-28"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> our current efforts are focused on inference
rather than training. The proposal under consideration is to
understand real-world usages (e.g. Teachable Machine) and target
transfer learning as the initial training use case for browser
related work. Inviting Irene and Kyle to share their experience
with Teachable Machine.</p>
<p><cite>Irene:</cite> I'm here with my colleague Kyle working with
the creative lab at Google; we've worked with engineers to make ML
technologies more accessible and easy for people to use. We've
developed a project called Teachable Machine, a Web tool that
allows training a classification model in the browser .
(<a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/teachablemachine-community/tree/master/libraries">ML training code</a>) You don't need to know anything about ML to
use the tool - children as young as 8 years old have been using it
successfully. You can create an image, audio or pose classification
model (the latter based on PoseNet). It has been used to create
games, engineers and designers have used it for prototypes,
teachers have been using it. It's based on TF.js which is a key
piece of our capabilities. In terms of in-browser training - we're
using transfer learning: the training in the app is relatively
quick because of that. In all cases, we're having the user
re-training a 2-dense layers. &nbsp;The tool makes it very easy to
collect the samples, and the training happens in the browser. We
lazy-load the base model in the browser - the size of the base
models range from 1.6 MB to 6MB (for the audio one). We haven't
focused on mobile too much, not so much because of hardware
limitations, but more because of the UI which would have to be
rethought quite a bit on mobile. Also, the WASM backend didn't
exist for TFJs when we developed this last year - we would use it
today. Another big motivation of using TFjs was privacy: none of
the collected samples are sent to the server. The data can be
optionally saved to a Google drive, but that's not a requirement,
and it means people can train their models without ever sharing
data with the server. One challenge we've hit is that it's really
hard to show how long a training would take - if there was an API
to help with that, it would have been really useful. This means it
was also hard to give an estimate in the limits of the app -
depending on the underlying hardware, you could use many different
sample set sizes. We also wanted to make it possible to convert
between models (e.g. TF to TF lite) - still lots of challenges in
this conversion, which required a lot of custom code. We found that
a lot of users didn't mind to wait a long time for the training to
finish (e.g. up to 1/2h) - there are not so many tools that help
achieve this with an easy tool, and then people were fine with the
wait.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> very engaging tool - my 8 years old kid has
used it successfully. It also drives the point that transfer
learning is possible in the browser today. I heard your need for
training time estimation - not sure we have any API for that; you
also mentioned the problem with running training in a background
tab - this could work with the System Lock API, I'll make sure this
gets considered in the said work.</p>
<p><cite>Irene:</cite> that's indeed was a challenge</p>
<p><cite>Kyle:</cite> indeed, relying on requestAnimationFrame
meant people were puzzled as to why their training was not
proceeding. Another issue is memory usage: if loading a lot of
images in a given tab, you might hit the limit. Also, different
browsers have very different speeds, which can be hard to
communicate to the end-user.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> there is ongoing work around memory
usage</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> WebPerf has work on this
https://github.com/w3c/device-memory/</p>
<p><cite>Kyle:</cite> when starting a training, it can create an
initial UI lock due to heavy compute usage - we didn't find a way
to prevent that</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> WebNN isn't focused on training in the
current phase of our work; transfer learning sounds like the 1st
initial use case we should look at for the future work in this
space - Chai, what do you think?</p>
<p><cite>Chai:</cite> WebNN is a graph API - that's good for
transfer learning. That's one of the advantages of focusing on
graph APIs. The model is able to implement transfer learning, but
the exact API shape to make that happen is still to be
discussed.</p>
<p><cite>Oguz:</cite> I want to mention a possible use case of
WebGPU in this aspect. Since WebGPU will make it easier to play
around with synthetic data, people like authors of next generation
textbooks might make use of it on topics like differentiable
rendering by creating widgets that might demonstrate training of
faster-to-converge networks, or maybe just some latents.</p>
<p><cite>Irene:</cite> all of the ML code is open-sourced, so it
could be reworked into different teachable machines!</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> hopefully we can help make the platform even
better in the future for this kind of project.</p>
<h3><a href=

    Training across devices #83</a></h3>
<div role="region" data-fmt=pdf data-src="http://www.w3.org/2020/Talks/mlws/live-sessions.pdf" id="slide-29"></div>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> this one is looking a bit further in the
future - training across devices. The summary of this issue: we
want to understand the role of edge computing in the platform. We
would need to define edge computing among other things. Multiple
talks touched this area, with federated learning, distributed
learning, reinforcement learning. I would like to invite Wolfgang
Maass to introduce thoughts on this.</p>
<p><cite>Wolfgang:</cite> let me first introduce our research
goals: consider any device belonging to a user as their agent,
trusted with data and models allowed to operate on these data. As a
user, I want to work with models in a very natural way: train it,
merge it with other models that others have shared with me. Some
models can be shared, some can't. There are also&nbsp;privacy
issues - e.g. GDPR allows to stop sharing, which would apply here.
We're working based on that perspective. All the tools that have
been mentioned&nbsp;(TF, PyTorch, ‚Ä¶) don't really provide that kind
of flexibility to operate in multi-agent kind of systems. With
federated learning, you always have different control formats.
We're looking at enabling models for flow back and forth</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> Thank you, your talk provides more details
on this - go check his talk if you want to learn more. Inviting
Yakun Huang to present his thoughts.</p>
<p><cite>Yakung:</cite> from BPUT - edge computing can provide
high-bandwidth&nbsp;/ low latency with 5G. Edge computing would
allow to provide high-computing from mobile Web to edge. To do
that, you need dynamic offloading decisions based on dynamic
network conditions and the status of mobile devices.</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> I would like to invite Zoltan to share
what's happening in the Web & Networks IG in this space.</p>
<p><cite>Zoltan:</cite> Edge computing is a very broad topic -
right now, the focus is computing offloading, with edge a
particular focus due to lower latency. With regard to ML, the
question is whether a generic computing is enough, or does it need
to be specific to ML? If the latter, any hints as to what kind of
accelerators would be preferred? What metadata about the compute
loads would need to be shared to identify the right edge nodes? The
IG has looked into various solutions using e.g. worker-based
architectures, with links from the github issue. We're particularly
interested in understanding what's needed to qualify a ML computing
offloaded task.</p>
<p><cite>Dom:</cite> +1 to Zoltan description - would want to hear
from the ML crowd what role they see Edge Computing play in this
space</p>
<p><cite>Anssi:</cite> we're at the end of our scheduled time, with
2 issues left that will be rescheduled. Next live session tomorrow
at the same time.</p>
